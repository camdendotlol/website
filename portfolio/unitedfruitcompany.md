This is a freelance project that derived from a class I took as a student. The class had planned to make a website full of content about the United Fruit Company, but extenuating circumstances prevented the website from being completed. A year later, I offered to make the site as a freelance job. It uses Wordpress as a headless CMS, and the frontend pulls all the content at build time.
