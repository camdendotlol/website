Chromapoll is a consensus polling site. Each poll option is given a color, and the colors are mixed according to their percentage of the vote. When you click on a poll, Chromapoll's entire UI will adjust its colors to match the poll. You will also see live results, thanks to the WebSocket API. Finally, Chromapoll's backend generates high-quality custom OpenGraph previews that appear when you share a poll on Facebook, Twitter, etc.
