The website you're on right now! Made with NextJS and a handful of React hooks. All the CSS is hand-written with no framework. I like to refresh the design a little bit once in a while, but most updates are just for my blog down below. The colors and background image change automatically to match the season. Depending on when you're visiting this site, the color of this card could be autumny orange, wintery blue, springy pink, or summery yellow.
