An informational website about Linear A, the mysterious undeciphered writing system of the ancient Minoans. It includes a page where you can explore the Linear A alphabet, which makes use of modals and React's useRef hook. There's a history page with detailed information about Linear A, as well as a really boring minigame. Finally, the resources page lists a bunch of other places to learn about the topic.
