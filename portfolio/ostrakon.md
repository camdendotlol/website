Ostrakon is a single-page application that allows users to create charts of their favorite music, books, and games. It pulls data from the LastFM, OpenLibrary, and IGDB APIs, but the chart generation code is generic enough to open up the possibility of support for other data sources in the future. While working on this project, I published my first npm package. I called it "topster" because that is the generic term for this type of chart in fandom communities. It uses the Canvas API to draw the chart, so the frontend and backend can use the same code. The linked URL will tell Ostrakon to generate an example chart so you can quickly explore its features.
