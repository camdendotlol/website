Personal website for Kauthar Marlie, filmmaker and graphic designer. I wanted to make a site without a JavaScript framework, so the code here is plain JavaScript. Click on the spinning hexagon to enable a fun night mode, where the headers turn random colors. Of course, all of this respects the "prefers-reduced-motion" accessibility setting, so users with that setting enabled will be served a simple non-animated site.
