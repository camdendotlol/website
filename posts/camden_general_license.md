Today I am excited to announce the release of a new license for software, the Camden General License. The full text of this license will be provided momentarily, but I must first outline the backstory (in recipe website format) for why this license came into existence.

There are two licenses that inspired the Camden General License, and I do not remember the names or authors of either. One was a standard GPL-style license with the added restriction that users cannot use the software "for evil". The drama surrounding that license made quite a splash on programming forums at the time, as readers who keep up with that sort of thing will likely remember. The second, less known and more recent, was a small game engine whose developers wrote a custom license stipulating that the software may only be used if the resulting product "glorifies God".

As pointed out by many internet pundits, these licenses are [non-free](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/categories.en.html), because they restrict the ways that people can use the product. You can imagine a Google engineer, standing at his ergonomic adjustable-height desk and scratching his beard, pondering whether his AI geolocation targeting algorithm is "good" or "evil". Naturally, these things are impossible for courts to rule on. If either of those licenses came before a court, the court would be forced into the unenviable position of defining what such subjective terms mean in a legal context.

That consideration, of course, rarely crosses the minds of the authors of such licenses, who are more concerned with erring on the side of caution, avoiding potential use of their code in ways that make them uncomfortable even at the expense of widespread adoption. From that perspective it is hard to see these licenses as a failure. In fact, they accomplished exactly what they meant to.

My entry into the world of bespoke licenses stands on the shoulders of its predecessors, with one crucial difference. Instead of hinging on subjective qualities, the Camden General License restricts its use to people named Camden.

I hope that I've filled all the loopholes, but I am not a lawyer and nothing in this post should be considered legal advice. Proper analysis of this license should be performed by a fully-qualified lawyer, who will no doubt be excited to take your money and have a nice laugh for the first time in 20 years.

In short, the Camden General License should allow the same freedoms provided by the [MIT License](https://mit-license.org/), but only to people whose first name is Camden. If the user is not named Camden, then standard copyright protections come into effect by default, as per the Berne Convention.

This website is now licensed under the Camden General License. If your first name is Camden, you are free to copy my code and use it for whatever you want. If your first name is not Camden, this site is ‚ö†Ô∏èproprietary‚ö†Ô∏è and you may not use its code for any purpose. But don't worry, it only took me [three days to build](/blog/hello), so you can build something similar as long as you don't copy too closely!

All of this website's dependencies use the MIT License (or something comparable), which is so free that it allows me to make non-free things with it.

## FAQ

### Why did you do this?

To benefit the Camdens of the world. üí™

### Aha! I've found a flaw that may invalidate your entire license in some jurisdictions! Camden is a masculine name, which makes this essentially a "male-only" license!

Nice try, but Camden is a [unisex name](http://www.ourbabynamer.com/Camden-name-popularity.html).

### I've found a loophole! I can just legally change my name to Camden and then use your code!

Go ahead.

### Do you think anyone named Camden will actually use this?

Nope.

### Do you intend to use this license on serious project?

Of course not. If you want my personal choices, I go with MIT when I'm okay with big corporations using my code, and GPL-3.0 (or AGPL-3.0) when I don't want big corporations to use my code.
