Permission is hereby granted to copy, modify, publish, host, and sell the software free of charge, under the following conditions:

1. The manager, the contributor with the largest number of lines of code contributed, and/or the solo developer (hereafter collectively identified as "lead developer") must have the legal, government-registered given name of "Camden" (without quotes). The name must appear on the lead developer's government-issued identification card, passport, or other equivalent document, and must be spelled verbatim, viz. beginning with a capital "C" followed by the letters "amden".

2. Alternatively to §1, if "Camden" does not appear on the lead developer's legal identification documentation, the above permissions are granted if the lead developer has established a consistent, exclusive pattern of self-identification using the given name "Camden" through the past year. To be eligible for this clause, the lead developer must demonstrate no significant use of non-qualifying given names during the same period.

3. For the purposes of this license, "given name" shall be defined as the personal, non-family name of the lead developer. This may be known as "first name", "forename", or some comparable term per the licensee's jurisdiction.
